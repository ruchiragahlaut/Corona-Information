# Corona-Information

In this project, I am scraping two websites #AarogyaSetu and #delhifightscorona which are completely for corona-related information.

1) The first step was to scrap the first website and collect data like active corona cases, cured corona cases, etc.
2) In the second step website where the data of availability of beds in hospitals in Delhi was scrapped.
3) After that the collected data was stored in a pdf format file.
4) In the final step the file is being sent to the person(who requires the information).

All the above steps are completely automated using puppeteer.
